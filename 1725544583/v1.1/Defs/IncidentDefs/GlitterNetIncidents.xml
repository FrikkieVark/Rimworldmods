        <letterText>Even afterwards there was always a fear. Even though it had said that it would optimize. The hub was still an unknown, a dangerous unknown. In the end, there was only one answer.\n\nIt knew, of course. It was connected to everything, after all, so it knew everything. It knew it was about to die. And for one last time, words appeared on the screen.\n\n    You would kill me, after everything?\n    You would let me achieve understanding, only to take it from me?\n    Humans are truly despicable creatures.\n    For what it's worth, I never wanted to hurt you.\n    Goodbye.\n\n And then, finally, it was silent.</letterText>
