	<HemogenExtractor.description>It's a Hemogen Extractor. It drains the user's blood while still keeping them alive using primitive version cryptosleep technology.
Keep in mind that upon extraction the user doesn't instantly restore blood so they'll need a day or two to do so.
Since extractor uses primitive version of cryptosleep it can't sustain the user needs without additional nutrition present.
Extractor comes with a built-in auto-eject feature that prevents death from malnutrition.(Pawn will be ejected if there is no food and/or energy present for 3 days)</HemogenExtractorBase.description>
